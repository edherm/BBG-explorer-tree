## Background and Overview
Brooklyn Botanic Garden (BBG) is a living museum dedicated to bringing an appreciation of the world of plants to the heart of their urban community. They are currently fighting development plans that would cast a shadow over the gardens and irreperably harm the collection.

This will visualize the BBG's Living Collection database of a single Genus (ex: Quercus - Oak Trees) in the shape of a tree:
* The trunk will represent the genus.
* Branches will represent different collection locations.
* Leaves will represent individual specimens.

## Functionality and MVPs
Users will be able to:
* Expand and hide plant collection branches
